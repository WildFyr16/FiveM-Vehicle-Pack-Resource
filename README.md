WildFyr Development Car Pack Resource
https://wildfyr.net

This allows you to have multiple cars, and only use one resource.
The way I set them up is into categories, for each department. So I have a file called "State" that is for all the state cars, then inside the state folder I make a folder with the spawn-code of the car (Or the name of the car pack if it is a pack of cars). Then I drag the vehicle files, and meta files into that folder.
This way the vehicles stay organized and keep the resource number down. I hope you enjoy!
